        When a neutral atom like Hydrogen is exposed to an electric field,
        the atom becomes polarized and develops a dipole moment in the direction of electric field.
        Experimentally, it has been observed that in the presence of an constant electric field $E$,
        the dipole moment $p$ follows the equation:
        \begin{align*}
        p = \alpha E
        \end{align*}
        Where $\alpha$ is known as the atomic polarizability and can be experimentally determined.
        <br><br>
        But what is the theoretical basis for this? Like all phenomena at this scale, this is a quantum mechanical
        problem.
        However, can we attempt to analyze this problem from a classical and electrostatic perspective?
        <br><br>
        The problem will be analyzed using model building of the atom
        and the physical concept that any system
        eventually attains the configuration of minimum of potential energy.

    <h1>Electrostatic Model of the Atom</h1>

    <div>
        To solve the problem, we first need an electrostatic model for the atom,
        atleast for single electron systems like Hydrogen atom in ground state.
        <br><br>
        The Hydrogen atom is approximated with a point charge (proton) surrounded by a uniform
        thin shell of total charge the same as the electron and radius $r$ (electron cloud). If we consider only
        electrostatic interactions, the atom is unstable. This can be seen if we write
        the potential energy of the configuration
        \begin{align}
        U &= U_{sphere} - \frac{ke^2}{r} \\
        &= \frac{1}{2} \frac{ke^2}{r} - \frac{ke^2}{r} \\
        &= - \frac{1}{2} \frac{ke^2}{r}
        \end{align}
        The self energy of a sphere is derived in the appendix. This potential energy
        is strictly decreasing with decrease in $r$, therefore the electron cloud
        will collapse.
        <br><br>
        To prevent this collapse, we introduce a 'magic' potential $U_{magic}$, a potential that
        has no physical basis and is just there to prevent the collapse of our atom.
        At this point, we can also take motivation from Bohr's model of the atom
        and construct the magic potential such that, in equilibrium, the electron cloud
        is at a distance same as the Bohr radius.
        <div class="theorem remark x">
            The magic potential is non-unique, however, it must be logically chosen
            to satisfy some qualitative theory or experimental data like Bohr's radii.
        </div>
        The potential energy can be written as:
        \begin{align}
        U &= U_{magic} - \frac{1}{2} \frac{ke^2}{r}
        \end{align}
        The system will attain the configuration of minimum potential energy, in other words $\dv{U}{r} = 0$.
        \begin{align}
        \dv{U}{r}\Big|_{r=r_0} &= \dv{U_{magic}}{r} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{ke^2}{r^2} = 0
        \end{align}
        Where $r_0 = \frac{\hbar^2}{kme^2}$ is the Bohr radius.
        For the purposes of this problem, we do not need to explicitly find a suitable magic potential,
        but a couple of sample potentials are given in the appendix.

    <h1>Energies of Atom in Uniform Electric Field</h1>
    <div>
        When the Hydrogen atom is placed in a uniform electric field $-E \hat{z}$, the electron cloud
        changes in both shape and charge distribution, while the nucleus shifts in position along $z$ axis.
        We make the approximation that the electron cloud remains spherical with same radius.
        We also make the assumption that the charge density varies as $\sigma(\theta) = \sigma_0 + \delta \cos{\theta}$
        where $\sigma_0 = \frac{-e}{4\pi r^2}$.
        <br><br>
        The nucleus is initially taken at $\vec{r} = \vec{0}$, the potential due to the electric field can be written as
        $V = Ez = E r \cos{\theta}$.
    </div>

    <section>
        <h1>Energy due to Potential of External Field</h1>

        <div>
            The energy of the nucleus is given by $eV = eEz$, while the energy of the cloud is:
            \begin{align}
            U_{E, cloud} &= \int V dq = \int V \sigma \, dA \\
            &= \int_0^\pi V \sigma 2 \pi r^2 \sin{\theta} \, d\theta \\
            &= \int_0^\pi E r \cos{\theta} (\sigma_0 + \delta \cos{\theta}) 2 \pi r^2 \sin{\theta} \, d\theta \\
            &= 2\pi E r^3 \int_0^\pi \cos{\theta} (\sigma_0 + \delta \cos{theta}) \sin{\theta} \, d\theta \\
            &= 2\pi E r^3 \int_0^\pi \delta \cos^2{\theta} \sin{\theta} \, d\theta \\
            &= \frac{4\pi E r^3}{3} \delta
            \end{align}
            The total energy due to the field is then:
            \begin{align}
            U_E = eEz + \frac{4\pi E r^3}{3} \delta
            \end{align}
        </div>

        U_{p, e} &= \int \frac{ke \, dq}{|\vec{r} - z \hat{z}|} \\
        &= \int_0^\pi \frac{ke \sigma 2 \pi r^2 \sin{\theta} \, d\theta}{\sqrt{|\vec{r} - z \hat{z}|^2}} \\
        &= 2\pi ke r^2 \int_0^\pi \frac{(\sigma_0 + \delta \cos{\theta}) \sin{\theta} \, d\theta}{\sqrt{r^2 + z^2 - 2rz
        \cos{\theta}}} \\
        &= 2\pi ke r^2 \frac{\sqrt{r^2+z^2 - 2rz \cos{\theta}} (\delta (r^2 + z^2 + rz \cos{\theta}) + 3rz
        \sigma_0)}{3r^2z^2}\Big|_0^\pi \\
        &= - \frac{ke^2}{r} + \frac{2\pi ke \delta}{3z^2} \sqrt{r^2+z^2 - 2rz \cos{\theta}} (r^2 + z^2 + rz
        \cos{\theta})\Big|_0^\pi \\
        &= - \frac{ke^2}{r} + \frac{2\pi ke \delta}{3z^2} 2z^3 \\
        &= - \frac{ke^2}{r} + \frac{4\pi ke}{3} \delta z\\

        <h1>Self Energy of Electron Cloud</h1>

        The self energy formula for non uniform spherical surface is derived in the Appendix.
        However, it requires calculating the potential due to the cloud close to it.
        This is potentially problematic as the potential calculation involves complicated integrals.
        Therefore, we first approximate the potential function.
        <br><br>
        Because of the symmetry of the distribution, the potential at $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$ is $-\frac{ke}{r}$.
        If we calculate the potential at $\theta=0, \pi$, we might be able to interpolate and get the potential function
        $V(\theta)$.
        <br><br>
        The potential at $\theta=0$ is given by:
        \begin{align}
        V(\theta = 0) &= \int \frac{k \, dq}{|\vec{r} - r \hat{z}|} \\
        &= \int_0^\pi \frac{k \sigma 2 \pi r^2 \sin{\theta} \, d\theta}{\sqrt{2r^2(1-\cos{\theta})}} \\
        &= \int_0^\pi \frac{k (\sigma_0 + \delta \cos{\theta}) 2 \pi r^2 \sin{\theta} \,
        d\theta}{\sqrt{4r^2\sin^2{\frac{\theta}{2}}}} \\
        &= k \pi r \int_0^\pi \frac{(\sigma_0 + \delta \cos{\theta}) \sin{\theta} \, d\theta}{\sin{\frac{\theta}{2}}} \\
        &= 2k \pi r \int_0^\pi (\sigma_0 + \delta \cos{\theta}) \cos{\frac{\theta}{2}} \, d\theta \\
        &= -\frac{ke}{r} + 2k \pi r \delta \int_0^\pi \cos{\theta} \cos{\frac{\theta}{2}} \, d\theta \\
        &= -\frac{ke}{r} + \frac{4k \pi r}{3} \delta \\
        \end{align}
        By the symmetry of the distribution, it is easy to see that $V(\theta=\pi) = -\frac{ke}{r} - \frac{4k \pi r}{3}
        \delta$.
        A good interpolating function is
        \begin{align}
        V(\theta) = -\frac{ke}{r} + \frac{4k \pi r}{3} \delta \cos{\theta}
        \end{align}

        <div>
            Now, the self energy of the cloud is given by
            \begin{align}
            U_{cloud} &= \frac{r^2}{2} \int_0^\pi \int_0^{2\pi} V \sigma \sin{\theta} \, d\phi \, d\theta \\
            &= \pi r^2 \int_0^\pi V \sigma \sin{\theta} \, d\theta \\
            &= \pi r^2 \int_0^\pi \left(-\frac{ke}{r} + \frac{4k \pi r}{3} \delta \cos{\theta}\right) (\sigma_0 + \delta \cos{\theta}) \sin{\theta} \, d\theta \\
            &= \frac{1}{2} \frac{ke^2}{r} + \pi r^2 \int_0^\pi \frac{4k \pi r}{3} \delta^2 \cos^2{\theta} \sin{\theta} \, d\theta \\
            &= \frac{1}{2} \frac{ke^2}{r} + \frac{8k \pi^2 r^3}{9} \delta^2  \\
            \end{align}
        </div>

        <h1>Energy due to Magic Potential</h1>
        <div>
            In general, the magic potential will vary with charge distribution and
            position of the nucleus. However, for cases like the 'pressure' model of the magic potential
            lead to energies independent of charge distribution and position of nucleus.
            We consider that the magic potential is independent of $z$ and $\delta$.

    <h1>Polarization of Atom in Electric Field</h1>

    The total energy of the system is given by
    \begin{align}
        U &= U_E + U_{p, e} + U_{cloud} + U_{magic} \\
        U(z, \delta) &= eEz + \frac{4\pi E r^3}{3} \delta + \frac{8k \pi^2 r^3}{9} \delta^2  + \frac{4\pi ke}{3} \delta z + \dots
    \end{align}
    Where terms independent of $z, \delta$ have been omitted. The system will have $z, \delta$ such that
    \begin{align}
        \pdv{U}{z} &= eE + \frac{4\pi ke}{3} \delta = 0 \\
        \pdv{U}{\delta} &= \frac{4\pi E r^3}{3} + \frac{16k \pi^2 r^3}{9} \delta + \frac{4\pi ke}{3} z = 0 \\
    \end{align}
    Solving the system of equations gives $\delta = -\frac{3E}{4\pi k} = -3\epsilon_0 E \\$ and $z = 0$.
    We can now calculate the dipole moment of the cloud
    \begin{align}
        p &= \int_0^\pi z \sigma 2 \pi r^2 \sin{\theta} \, d\theta \\
        &= \int_0^\pi (\sigma_0 + \delta \cos{\theta}) 2 \pi r^3 \cos{\theta} \sin{\theta} \, d\theta \\
        &= 2 \pi r^3 \int_0^\pi \delta \cos^2{\theta} \sin{\theta} \, d\theta \\
        &= \frac{4 \pi r^3}{3} \delta \\
        &= - 4 \pi \epsilon_0 r^3 E \\
    \end{align}
    This points along the electric field as expected and is proportional to the magnitude of the field.
    <br><br>
    The atomic polarizability is given by $4\pi \epsilon_0 r^3$.

    <h1>Comparision with Experimental Data</h1>
    The experimental value of $\frac{\alpha}{4\pi \epsilon_0}$ is $0.667 \cdot 10^{-30} m^3$,
    while the theoretical model gives $0.148 \cdot 10^{-30} m^3$. This is good agreement
    considering the approximations made.
    <div class="theorem remark x">
        Quantum mechanics predicts the phenomena of tunnel ionization, where strong electric fields
        can cause the atom to be ionized. For Hydrogen atom, this is of the order $10^{11} V/m$.
        <br><br>
        With the current calculations, given sufficient electric field, the electron cloud will contain
        regions of positive charge density for $\delta > \sigma_0$. This is not physical
        and corresponds to the ionization electric field. A simple calculation gives that $E > \frac{ke}{3r^2}$
        would yield this situation.

        <h1>Self Energy of Sphere</h1>

        <div>
            The problem is to find the potential energy of a spherical shell of radius $r$
            and charge $Q$ distributed uniformly.
            To construct this system, take an uncharged sphere and slowly add small charges to it,
            bringing the charges from infinity.
            If at any point the system has charge $q$ and a charge $dq$ is brought from infinity,
            the increase in potential energy is:
            \begin{align}
            dU &= \frac{kq}{r} dq \\
            U &= \int_0^Q \dv{U}{q} dq \\
            &= \frac{1}{2} \frac{kQ^2}{r}

        <h1>Self Energy of non-uniform Sphere</h1>

        <div>
            Consider a charge sphere with surface charge distribution $\sigma(r, \theta, \phi)$.
            We construct such a sphere by bringing shells of charge $d\lambda \sigma$ from infinity to the radius of the
            sphere.
            <br><br>
            Let the potential due to the distribution be $V(r, \theta, \phi)$.
            When the sphere has distribution $\lambda \sigma$, $0 \lt \lambda \lt 1$, the potential
            due to it will be $\lambda V$. The increase in potential energy by bringing a charge $d\lambda \sigma dA$
            at $(r, \theta, \phi)$ is given by
            \begin{align}
            dU = \lambda V \sigma r^2 \sin{\theta} \,d\theta \,d\phi \,d\lambda
            \end{align}
            Integrating $\lambda$ from $0$ to $1$ and the rest as usual, we get:
            \begin{align}
            U = \frac{r^2}{2} \int_0^\pi \int_0^{2\pi} V \sigma \sin{\theta} \, d\phi \, d\theta
            \end{align}
        </div>

    <section>
        <h1>Magic Potential (Pressure)</h1>
        Here we construct a magic potential whose source is physical and
        is attributed to 'pressure' due to charge density which prevents further collapse of the electron cloud.
        <br><br>
        Consider a simple magic potential which follows a power law $\frac{\lambda}{r^{\alpha}}$,
        then the total energy is:
        \begin{align}
        U = \frac{\lambda}{r^\alpha} - \frac{1}{2} \frac{ke^2}{r}
        \end{align}
        Differentiating, equating to $0$ and using Bohr's radius $r = \frac{\hbar^2}{mke^2}$, we get the value of
        $\lambda$ as:
        \begin{align}
        \lambda = \frac{1}{2\alpha} \frac{k^{2-\alpha}}{m^{\alpha -1 }} e^{2(2-\alpha)} \hbar^{2(\alpha - 1)}
        \end{align}
        It is intuitive enough that this magic potential must be increasing with charge of cloud, hence the power
        of $e$ must be positive and $\alpha \lt 2$. Note that $\alpha = \frac{3}{2}$ gives particularly
        'nice' results:
        \begin{align}
        \lambda = \frac{\hbar}{3} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} e
        \end{align}
        This is even 'nicer' because it depends only on the total charge of the cloud, not the distribution of the
        charge.
        We can write the energy in differential form like:
        \begin{align}
        dU_{magic} = \frac{\hbar}{3} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \frac{\sigma \,dA}{r^{\frac{3}{2}}}
        \end{align}
        Integrating $\sigma \,dA$ just gives $e$ and we need not worry about the distribution,
        this will be especially useful when considering a polarized atom.
        <div class="theorem remark x">
            Note that this magic potential will not yield the radii from Bohr's model
            for a nucleus with charge $Ze$.
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>Magic Potential (Bohr's Model)</h1>
        Here we construct a magic potential that leads to radii that
        conform to Bohr's atomic model.
        <br><br>
        Following notation from Bohr's model, suppose the nucleus has charge $Ze$,
        and let $U_{magic}$ be the potential energy due to one unit charge on nucleus.
        The energy of the system is then:
        \begin{align}
        U = Z U_{magic} - \left(Z - \frac{1}{2}\right) \frac{ke^2}{r}
        \end{align}
        Differentiating and using the fact that radius of atom is $\frac{r_0}{Z}$,
        \begin{align}
        \dv{U_{magic}}{r}\Big|_{r=\frac{r_0}{Z}} &= - \left(Z - \frac{1}{2}\right)
        \frac{ke^2}{Z\left(\frac{r_0}{Z}\right)^2} \\
        &= - \left(\frac{1}{\left(\frac{r_0}{Z}\right)^2} - \frac{1}{2r_0 \frac{r_0}{Z}}\right) ke^2 \\
        &= - \left(\frac{1}{r^2} - \frac{1}{2r_0 r}\right) ke^2
        \end{align}
        For simplicity, assume that this is valid for all $r$, we can then get $U_{magic}$ by integrating:
        \begin{align}
        U_{magic} = \left(\frac{\ln{r}}{2r_0} + \frac{1}{r} \right) ke^2
        \end{align}
