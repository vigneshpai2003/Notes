    <h1>Definitions</h1>
    A system consists of particles, the space of configurations of the system
    is the <i>state space</i>. When configurations are described using positions and momenta
    of the particles, it is also known as a <i>phase space</i>.
    <br><br>
    The dynamics of the system must be <i>deterministic</i> and <i>reversible</i>.
    Where reversible just means deterministic into the past.
    If the state space is discrete, the the dynamics can be described using a directed graph
    with the configurations as vertices. Each configuration has exactly one edge
    stemming to and from it. This fundamental constraint is known as the <i>conservation of information</i>.
    <br><br>
    In the discrete case, there may exist dynamical laws that lead to multiple cycles in the graph.
    We can assign a meaningful value $Q$ to each configuration in the space
    such that every vertex in a cycle has the same value, since the system will always
    be on a vertex of the same cycle, there is a <i>conservation law</i> on $Q$.

        <h1>Force and Energy</h1>
        Force is an entity that changes state of motion of an object. Mass is a measure of the inertia of the object.
        Forces are generally observed to be only position dependent.
        This gives an intuition that perhaps the universe is using force
        as an entity to minimize some <i>potential energy</i> function.
        In one dimension
        \begin{align}
            F = - \dv{V(x)}{x}
        \end{align}
        Note that this is more of a definition of $V$ rather than a constraint on $F$.
        The <i>kinetic energy</i> function is chosen as a function of the phase for conveniently
        defining a conserved quantity.
        <br><br>
        If Newton's laws are true, the function $T = \frac{1}{2} mv^2$ satisfies that that $T+V$
        is a conserved quantity.
        <div class="theorem remark">
            Our universe is such that the fundamental forces are conservative, so we can
            extend this to three dimensions:
            \begin{align}
                F = - \nabla V
            \end{align}

        <h1>The Lagrangian Method</h1>
        Newtonian physics deals with an initial value problem, the initial conditions
        are specified and the trajectory of the system is obtained.
        Lagrangian physics on the other hand is a boundary value problem, consider a particle that moves
        between two points under a potential. There are many paths it may take, but which does it actually take?
        The <i>principle of stationary action</i> claims that the particle will move such that the action along the path is stationary.
        <div class="theorem remark">
            This is analogous to the group velocity of a wave. The group velocity occurs
            when the wave velocity of a frequency is constant for small variations in frequency.
            If it wasn't constant, the various sinosoidal variations would cancel out on average over time.
            The group velocity is a sort of resonance of several waves.
            <br><br>
            The Lagrangian theory can be interpreted in quantum mechanics as the particle taking each and
            every path between the points. Most of the paths interfere destructively,
            except the paths around which the action is stationary.
        </div>
        For every system we can find a Lagrangian function $L$ and define the action on a path as:
        \begin{align}
            S(x) := \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(x, \dot{x}, t) \, dt
        \end{align}
        <section>
            <h1>Euler Lagrange Equations</h1>
            If the particle's path is perturbed by a small amount $\epsilon \beta(t)$
            with arbritrary $\beta$ such that the endpoints are still the same.
            \begin{align}
                \delta S &:= \dv{S(x_0 + \epsilon \beta)}{\epsilon} \Big|_{\epsilon=0} \\
                &= \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \pdv{L}{x} \beta + \pdv{L}{\dot{x}} \dot{\beta} \, dt \\
                &= \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \left(\pdv{L}{x} - \dv{}{t}\pdv{L}{\dot{x}}\right) \beta \, dt \\
            \end{align}
            Since this must hold for any $\beta$,
            \begin{align}
                \pdv{L}{x} = \dv{}{t}\pdv{L}{\dot{x}}
            \end{align}
            For classical mechanics, $L = T - V$ agrees with Newton's laws.
            This form of $L$ doesn't have any deeper meaning as to why it is the way it is.
            Remember that $T$ was 'derived' in Newtonian mechanics for convenience,
            the fact that it shows up here is a coincidence.

            <h1>Generalized Coordinates and Momenta</h1>
            $p_i = \pdv{L}{\dot{q_i}}$ is called the generalized momentum conjugate to $q_i$,
            in cartesian coordinates it is the same as momentum.
            In polar coordinates, the conjugate momentum of $r$ is $m\dot{r}$
            and that of $\theta$ is $mr\dot{\theta}^2$ (angular momentum).
            <br><br>
            Coordinates are <i>cyclic</i> when they do not explicitly appear in $L$,
            but their velocities do. In this case, their conjugate momentum is conserved.

        <h1>Spatial Symmetries</h1>
        Consider a change of coordinates $q_i'=q_i'(\{q_i\})$.
        If the system under this new set of coordinates does not change the Lagrangian,
        the Lagrangian is said to be <i>symmetric</i> with respect to the transformation.
        Consider an infinitesimal transformation
        \begin{align}
            q_i' = q_i + \epsilon f_i(\{q_i\})
        \end{align}
        The change in the Lagrangian is
        \begin{align}
            \delta L &= \sum \left(\pdv{L}{q_i} \epsilon f_i(\{q_i\}) + \pdv{L}{\dot{q_i}} \epsilon \dot{f_i}(\{q_i\}))\right) \\
            &= \sum \left(\dv{}{t}\pdv{L}{\dot{q_i}} f_i(\{q_i\}) + \pdv{L}{\dot{q_i}} \dot{f_i}(\{q_i\}))\right) \epsilon \\
            &= \sum \dv{}{t}\left(\pdv{L}{\dot{q_i}} f_i(\{q_i\})\right) \epsilon \\
            &= \dv{}{t}\left( \sum \pdv{L}{\dot{q_i}} f_i(\{q_i\})\right) \epsilon = 0 \\
        \end{align}
        The symmetry leads to the conserved quantity $\sum \pdv{L}{\dot{q_i}} f_i(\{q_i\})$.
