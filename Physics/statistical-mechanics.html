    <h1>Boltzmann Distribution</h1>
    Consider a system of $N$ particles distributed in the energy levels of the system.
    Each particle may be in any of the energy levels, the particles and their corresponding energy levels
    is known as the microstate of the system. Since the particles are indistinguishable,
    multiple microstates may lead to the same energy distribution (configuration).
